Graph 2 never converged with a dampening of 1

Graph 3 never converged with a dampening of 0.85
Graph 3 never converged with a dampening of 1

## Part 3 Section B

It seems that both the page rank vector and the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 both share a similar pattern in values. In graph 1, you can see that it is like this [largest, third largest, second largest, fourth largest] and this pattern holds through.
